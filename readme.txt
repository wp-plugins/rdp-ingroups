RDP Wiki-Press Embed lets you embed MediaWiki pages in to your site, from sites like Wikipedia, and PediaPress book pages.

== Description ==

RDP Wiki-Press Embed will pull content from any MediaWiki website (such as wikipedia.org) and from PediaPress.
It strips and reformats the content, allowing you to supply some arguments to dictate how this works.

RDP Wiki-Press Embed also allows lead capture capabilities, utilizing free PediaPress ebooks as an offer.
The default behavior is to display two tabs. The first tab will display whatever text, HTML, and/or another shortcode you desire. The second tab will display the original PediaPress.com book page within an iframe.


= Known Issues =

* CSS clashes with Lightbox Plus Colorbox plug-in



Forked from: [Wiki Embed plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wiki-embed/  "Wiki Embed plugin").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Could you use this to replicate the whole of Wikipedia = 

Maybe, but why would you want to? That is not what the tool was designed to do. 


== Usage ==

If you are not using "Overwrite" mode, make sure to un-tick the box for "Look for all links to wiki sites listed in the Security section..."


= Wiki Content =
RDP Wiki-Press Embed is implemented using the shortcode [wiki-embed]. It accepts the following arguments:

* url: (required) the web address of the wiki article that you want to embed on this page.
* no-edit: Hide the "edit" links from the wiki.
* no-contents: Hide the page's contents box.
* no-infobox: Hide any infobox that appears on the wiki for this page.
* tabs: Replaces the sections of the wiki article with tabs.
* accordion: Replaces the sections of the wiki article with an accordion. This option cannot be used as the same time as 'tabs'.

Example:

[wiki-embed url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example" no-edit no-contents no-infobox accordion]

For the Call-to-Action button to appear, the shortcode must be an enclosing shortcode, containing text, HTML, and/or another shortcode, between the opening and closing shortcode tags.

[wiki-embed url='http://pediapress.com/books/show/american-warplanes-of-wwii-fighters-bombe' toc_show='1' toc_links='logged-in' cta_button_top_color='#eded00' cta_button_text_shadow_color='#cd8a15']`<iframe src="http://www.w3schools.com"></iframe>`[/wiki-embed]

The layout for displaying each book in the gallery is based on the template file located at: 

`resources/ppgallery-template/ppgallery.column.results.html`

A sample template that displays buttons is located at: 

`resources/ppgallery-template/ppgallery.column.results-sample.html`


Examples:

[wiki-embed-ppgallery col='3' num='3']

[wiki-embed-ppgallery col='2' num='10' cat='5' tag='7,8' sort_col='post_date' sort_dir='DESC' /]


For the Call-to-Action button to appear, the shortcode must be an enclosing shortcode, containing text, HTML, and/or another shortcode, between the opening and closing shortcode tags.

[wiki-embed-ppgallery col='3' num='3' cta_button_font_hover_color='#8224e3']`<iframe src="http://www.w3schools.com"></iframe>`[/wiki-embed-ppgallery]


== Configuration ==

Settings for the plugin can be found in 'Wiki Embed' -> 'Settings'.
Here you can enable/disable various features, define shortcode defaults, and configure some global settings for the plugin.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `rdp-wiki-embed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to 'Wiki Embed' -> 'Settings' and change the wiki embed settings to your liking
4. Click the 'Save Changes' button at the bottom of the settings page - even if you do not make any changes - so settings take affect
5. Go to 'Settings' -> 'Permalinks' and click the 'Save Changes' button so the custom RSS feeds will work.

= Gallery Items =
To change the way each book is displayed in gallery view, you will need to copy the template file located at: 

`resources/ppgallery-template/ppgallery.column.results.html`

Put the copy into a folder named *rdp-wiki-press-embed*, in the uploads directory, and then modify it as desired.


A sample template that displays buttons is located at: 

`resources/ppgallery-template/ppgallery.column.results-sample.html`

= Extra =
To make everything pretty, add a wiki.custom.css and pediapress.custom.css file to your theme's folder. Start with the wiki.custom-sample.css and pediapress.custom-sample.css files located in the 'resources/css/' folder.



== Screenshots ==
